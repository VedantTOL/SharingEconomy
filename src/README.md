      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>The user is first welcomed by a menu that asks them whether they are a
      buyer or seller. The response is taken in the form of an integer, where "1"
identifies them as a buyer and two identifies them as a seller. They also have the
option to exit the program which stops the program. Once they identify as either a 
buyer or seller, they are then prompted to either log in or create a new account. The
login information and passwords are stored in a text file. Once the user is determined
to be either a seller or buyer, a respective menu for each identity is then displayed.</p>

<p>If the user elects to delete the store, a list of stores appears that are numbered.

way it is shown when asking the seller to delete a store. They then enter the number of the store

edit the store name, add products to a store, edit products, and delete products.<p></p>

of questions to identify all the necessary information about the product.<p>

sellers, stores, and products. It allows customers to browse and purchase
products, add to shopping carts, and manage purchases. The class includes 
methods for writing and reading customer and vendor databases from a text file. 
The BuyProduct method enables customers to purchase a product, change the inventory 
levels in the store, and add the purchase to the customerâ€™s purchase history. Another method
such as the removeFromShoppingCart method removes an item from the customer's shopping cart. 
The viewProduct method displays information about an object on the console. The viewStore method
returns the store where an item is sold. Lastly, the addToShoppingCart method adds an item to the shopping 
cart if the item is in the store and has an available quantity. As a note, the account that the buyer has will
classify it as a buyer account and the account that a seller has will classify it as a seller account. This will
make sure that the shop by seller functions work and that the data is written to the proper file.<p>
